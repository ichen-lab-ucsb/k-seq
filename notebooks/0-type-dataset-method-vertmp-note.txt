This contains the naming convention for this notebooks
For possible future compatibility (google web search), please don't use underscore (_), only hyphen (-)
All letter should be non-capitalized
We sacrifice readablility and use camelcase for words, no camelCase, Camelcase, or CamelCase

**yeah hyphen is not allowed in python module naming, so, every file type is different
