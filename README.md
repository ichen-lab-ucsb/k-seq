kinetic sequencing: high through-put kinetic parameter estimation for genetic encoded biomolecules 
==============================


## Installation / update 

*This is the temporary installation for `k-seq` package before publication, we will upload to pypi so it could be installed through `pip install k-seq`* 

Step 1: Clone the this git repo to your local

```bash
> cd /dir/to/save/repo
> git clone https://github.com/ichen-lab-ucsb/k-seq.git

```

Step 2: run installation code

```bash
> cd /dir/to/save/repo/k-seq/
> sh ./install.sh
```

There might be a prop to uninstall the old `k-seq` package.


#### To varify the installation of package
```bash
> python -c "import k-seq"
# No error shows
```
