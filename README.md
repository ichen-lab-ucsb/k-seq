k-seq: analytic toolbox for data from kinetic assay with DNA sequencing
==============================

`k-seq` is a Python package for analyzing the data from *k*-Seq experiments, kinetic assay for biomolecules with DNA sequencing. Check out our paper [*Kinetic sequencing (k-Seq) as a massively parallel assay for ribozyme kinetics: utility and critical parameters*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.02.407346v1)
for the *k*-Seq experiment method and how we used the package for data analysis. To repeat the analysis in the paper using the code version snapshot, see the [`paper-archive` branch](https://github.com/ichen-lab-ucsb/k-seq/tree/paper-archive).



## Install `k-seq`

`k-seq` package and its dependencies can be installed from `pip` directly:
```shell script
pip install k-seq
```

## Quick start and documentation

Please check out the package [documentation]() and [quick start]() for further details on using the package
